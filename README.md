# FormJS

This library attempts to solve many of the headaches when building and developing forms on the web. It does quite a few things, but most notably:

1. Allows you totally restyle a native browser's form elements, which can be difficult to override when using css.
2. Provides an API to programmatically manipulate form elements via javascript.

UI Elements include:

 * Checkboxes
 * Button Toggles
 * Input Fields
 * Entire forms
 * and more to come...

Supports IE9+, all modern browsers, and mobile.

## Included Libraries

* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) - AMD and dependency management
* [ElementKit](https://github.com/mkay581/element-kit) - Fast DOM manipulation for html elements
* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) - Lightweight javascript goodies


## Usage

To use any classes in FormJS, you must [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) to import them. The Classes assume you have a thorough understanding of the [AMD model](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD). If not, please see the RequireJS website.
 
Usage can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/mkay581/formjs/blob/master/examples) page.
